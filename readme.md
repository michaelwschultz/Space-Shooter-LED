## Goal of this project
Build a 2D vertical-scrolling space shooter using a 32 x 64 [LED display](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2279).

This is my first hardware project and my first game. I played around with a Raspberry Pi at work for the first time and was instantly taken by how magical it feels to plug in an LED, writing some code and see it light up.

After browsing around [Adafruit.com](http://adafruit.com) looking at all the different parts that were available, I quickly made up my mind to build a game; something I'd wanted to do for a long time. This was the perfect opportunity due to the fact that it would help me continue my learning of Javascript and teach me something new.

## Parts List

## Design
Designs are also a work in progress but we have a [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/ZdafTZipsZgCy0pVW7ywhoDz/LED-screen?node-id=0%3A1) that you're welcome to take a look at.
