# ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS ðŸš§ Space Shooter for Raspberry Pi and LED display
Written by [Michael Schultz](http://twitter.com/michaelschultz) with MASSIVE help from [Marc Mendiola](http://twitter.com/codemookie). People that put up with my never ending questions... Sam McDonald and Scott Southerland.

This game includes an HTML simulator for testing game logic. You can run the game in the simulator now by starting a python server inside the root directory.

`$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

## Goal of this project
Build a 2D side-scrolling space shooter using a 16 x 32 [LED display](https://www.adafruit.com/products/420).

This is my first hardware project and my first game. I played around with a Raspberry Pi at work for the first time and was instantly taken by how magical it feels to plug in an LED, writing some code and see it light up.

After browsing around [Adafruit.com](http://adafruit.com) looking at all the different parts that were available, I quickly made up my mind to build a game; something I'd wanted to do for a long time. This was the perfect opportunity due to the fact that it would help me continue my learning of Javascript and teach me something new.
